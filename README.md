**Simple time tracker app for Android**
Features Check in/out, set break and note, view totals by various periods, export to pdf, and more.

Please note that:
- I use this timetracker on a (nearly) daily basis for my personal use
- The app is tested only on:
    - Samsung Galaxy S4 running Android api 21 (my own phone)
    - Nexus 5X running Andoid api 23 (virtual device)
- The default language for the app is english, but will be dutch depending on the locale of the device the app is running on
